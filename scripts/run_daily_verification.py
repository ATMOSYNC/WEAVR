"""Rolling verification and drift detection -- issue #8's last checkbox.

Reuses `weavr.drift`'s trailing-window rescoring and drift-flagging on top
of `weavr.verify`'s existing metrics (RMSE/bias, the same functions every
`run_tierN_*.py` script already calls), rather than a one-shot full-season
score.

## What this script actually runs against today, stated plainly

`docs/phase6-operational-scope.md` decided the real daily pipeline (step 4)
fetches AIFS/IFS/HRES fresh each day via `ecmwf_open_data.py`, not the
frozen `data/baseline_2020_jjas.zarr` store -- but step 4 hasn't been built
yet, so there is no real accumulated daily history to roll a window over
yet. This script demonstrates the real mechanism (`weavr.drift`) against
the only real accumulated history that exists today: the baseline store's
**18 real weekly JJAS-2020 samples** (`graphcast`/`hres`/`ifs_ens_mean`
precipitation vs. `imd_observed`, the same sources/alignment
`scripts/run_tier0_baseline.py` uses). Each real weekly sample stands in
for "one accumulated day" here -- a real, stated granularity mismatch with
`weavr.drift.TRAILING_WINDOW_SAMPLES = 14`'s own real-calendar-day
justification, not hidden. Once step 4's daily pipeline has been running
for a few weeks, this same code operates on literal daily history instead;
nothing here needs to change for that, since `weavr.drift` only ever sees
an ordered score series, indifferent to what real calendar time each entry
spans.

**Baseline overlaps the trailing window today, stated plainly.** With only
17-18 real historical samples total and a 14-sample trailing window, there
isn't enough real history to hold out a non-overlapping baseline period the
way a mature deployment would -- the baseline computed here
(`weavr.drift.compute_baseline_stats`) is fit from the *entire* real
sample series, the same series the trailing window is drawn from. This is
this project's own established small-sample caution
(`docs/tier2-hierarchical-baseline-results.md`'s own 57%-fallback finding,
`docs/phase5-regime-conditioned-results.md`'s own small-sample caveat)
applying here too: a "no drift detected" result from this run is
inconclusive-on-more-data, not proof today's pipeline is stable, exactly
the same honest distinction Phase 5 step 4 drew for its own go/no-go
result.

Checked directly, not just argued: whenever `n <= weavr.drift.
TRAILING_WINDOW_SAMPLES` (today's real case, `n=17` or `18`),
`trailing_window_value` and `compute_baseline_stats` are computed from the
exact same full sample series, so the rolling value collapses to precisely
the baseline mean -- drift *cannot* fire here no matter how large a real
shift is, not merely "is less sensitive." Proven in
`tests/test_run_daily_verification.py` (`TestRollingVerificationForLead::
test_baseline_overlapping_the_trailing_window_masks_a_shift_when_n_le_window`)
with a synthetic 500mm late-sample error injection that still scores
`is_drift=False`. This resolves on its own once step 4's daily pipeline has
accumulated more than `TRAILING_WINDOW_SAMPLES` real days of history to
hold a baseline period separate from the rolling window -- no code change
needed here for that, only more real data.

## Real historical spread this module's threshold is grounded in

Computed directly against `data/baseline_2020_jjas.zarr` (graphcast
precipitation, all 5 leads, per-sample domain-wide RMSE across the 18 real
weekly JJAS-2020 samples):

| Lead | n | mean (mm) | std (mm) | min (mm) | max (mm) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 24h  | 18 | 13.888 | 4.675 | 5.219 | 20.801 |
| 48h  | 18 | 13.493 | 3.867 | 5.182 | 21.578 |
| 72h  | 18 | 14.405 | 4.000 | 8.566 | 20.196 |
| 96h  | 17 | 15.038 | 3.837 | 9.942 | 23.260 |
| 120h | 17 | 14.672 | 3.906 | 9.267 | 21.160 |

`std/mean` sits at ~28-33% consistently across leads -- see
`src/weavr/drift.py`'s own module docstring for how this grounds
`TRAILING_WINDOW_SAMPLES`/`DRIFT_THRESHOLD_STD_MULTIPLIER`.
