Step 07's own history is a list of ways a run can look successful and not be:
a fold silently overwritten (244 -> 122 rows), a season scoring `nan` because
its store was missing, a BMA CRPS of 1540 where 4.9 belongs, a CSV whose
header does not match its rows. Each of those passed a "did it write a file"
check. This checks the numbers instead.

#: value near 4.9. Domain CRPS on this evidence base runs 4.5-5.1mm, so 200mm

#: 25th percentile, while the highest legitimate row (bma/heavy/WI at lead
#: 120) is 1.2x. 2.5x sits in that gap.
BIN_OUTLIER_RATIO = 2.5

#: Which quantile of the group is the reference. Deliberately NOT the median:
#: a fit that blows up *inflates* the group, so with few regions the outliers
#: drag the median toward themselves and hide. Measured: with 4 regions and 2
#: outliers the median lands at 65mm, the ratios fall to 1.8x and 1.6x, and
#: both degenerate rows slip under the threshold. The 25th percentile is
#: barely moved by a minority of inflating rows (28.4mm on the real data,

#: Largest daily 24h accumulation on the IMD grid, measured from

MAX_OBSERVED_DAILY_MM = 400.0
PHYSICAL_MAX_MM = 3.0 * MAX_OBSERVED_DAILY_MM

#: Blocking: the evidence base itself cannot be trusted. The domain aggregate
#: and the per-day files are what every pre-registered verdict is computed

#: domain magnitude means the numbers must not be used. The gate exits 1.
failures: list[str] = []

#: Advisory: something is wrong that does NOT invalidate the domain numbers.
#:
#: Reported just as loudly, but the gate still exits 0. This exists because the
#: by-bin breakdown can carry a degenerate per-(bin, region) fit -- measured
#: at ~0.2% of scored cell-days on the real run -- while the cell-weighted
#: domain CRPS stays at 4.6mm and no verdict moves. Blocking on that would
#: stall unrelated downstream work (Step 12's EVT) behind a diagnostic detail
#: of the tier being reported, which is a worse failure than the one being
