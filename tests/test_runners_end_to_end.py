"""End-to-end rehearsal of every scoring runner, on miniature stores.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Two separate two-hour Tier 2 runs were lost, for two unrelated reasons, and
neither was caught by any test:

* `data/ifs_ens_2020_jjas_daily.zarr` was 3.4 MB of **zeros** with the right
  shape, dates and dtype. Zeros are not NaN, so every structural check passed.
* The by-bin CSV write raised `ValueError: dict contains fields not in
  fieldnames: 'rmse_mm'` *after* the numbers were computed, because fieldnames
  came from `rows[0]` and the pooled rows carry a column the per-fold rows do
  not. The per-day scores were still buffered and went with it.

Both are invisible to a unit test that calls one function, and far too
expensive to find by running the real 2.3 GB stores. `tests/synthetic_stores`
builds a schema-faithful replica of the whole store set at ~1/1000 scale, so
the real runners can be executed for real -- CLI, argparse, exit codes and all
-- in seconds.

Run this before any multi-hour regeneration. It is the rehearsal; the real
stores are the performance.
